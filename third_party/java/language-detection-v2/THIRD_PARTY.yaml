  src/com/cybozu/labs/langdetect/DetectorFactory.java: Added method loadDefaultProfiles to load the profiles directly from the jar.
  src/com/cybozu/labs/langdetect/Detector.java: >
                                                   Detector now is deterministic and processes the whole input.
                                                   Replaced ArrayList with List.
                                                   Replaced StringBuffer with StringBuilder.
                                                   Removed maximum length constraint.
                                                   append now does all the cleanup with a single REGEX and does not normalize vietnamese.
                                                   Use Arrays.copyOf to copy arrays.
                                                   Use Arrays.fill to initialize array.
                                                   Remove unneeded check from updateLangProb.
                                                   sortProbabilities now uses Collections.sort.

                                                       Changed order of assert, first should be the expected value.
                                                       Changed multiple asserts to list asserts.
  src/com/cybozu/labs/langdetect/util/NGram.java: >
                                                     Replaced the StringBuffer with a single char array.
                                                     Replaced HashMap with Map.
