      # http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=7129299
      #
      # This has been observed to cause a problem in integration tests such as
      # CachedTestIntegrationTest where `buck build //:test` is run repeatedly
      # such that a corresponding `test.jar` file is overwritten several times.
      # The CompiledClassFileFinder in JavaTestRule creates a java.util.zip.ZipFile
      # to enumerate the zip entries in order to find the set of .class files
      # in `test.jar`. This interleaving of reads and writes appears to match
      # the conditions to trigger the issue reported on bugs.sun.com.
      #
      # Currently, we do not set this flag in bin/buck_common, as Buck does not
      # normally modify the contents of buck-out after they are loaded into
      # memory. However, we may need to use this flag when running buckd where
      # references to zip files may be long-lived.
      #
      # Finally, note that when you specify this flag,
      # `System.getProperty("sun.zip.disableMemoryMapping")` will return `null`
      # even though you have specified the flag correctly. Apparently sun.misc.VM
      # (http://www.docjar.com/html/api/sun/misc/VM.java.html) saves the property
      # internally, but removes it from the set of system properties that are
      # publicly accessible.
